#Car Web Application: 

The point of this web application was to create insight and analysis in comparing used cars. Created histograms and scatterplots to help a potential buyer visualise key points about the vehicle advertisements and aid in making decisions about cars they may be potentially interested in. Used plotly-express to create the histograms and scatterplot, used pandas for the Exploratory Data Analysis and used streamlit to built the application. What resulted was a comprehensive application dashboard that gives potential buyers good insight into the advertisements and making better car purchasing decisions.

If anybody wishes to launch locally they could fork my project directly from GitHub as I've made it publically available for any to use there they can use git clone on their local PC to add and edit any potential mistakes or gain insight into the ideas and construction behind the app if they were working on a similar project.
