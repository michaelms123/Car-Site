#Car Web Application: 

The point of this web application was to create insight and analysis in comparing used cars. Created histograms and scatterplots to help a potential buyer visualise key points about the vehicle advertisements and aid in making decisions about cars they may be potentially interested in. Used plotly-express to create the histograms and scatterplot, used pandas for the Exploratory Data Analysis and used streamlit to built the application. What resulted was a comprehensive application dashboard that gives potential buyers good insight into the advertisements and making better car purchasing decisions.

The GitHub repository works with render and streamlit to run the web application, the app.py file holds the code that runs the application itself. The .streamlit directory holds the config.toml file which specifies the port for the website and allows the application to run on the internet, the requirements.txt file specifies the required Python packages for running the app. If one wishes to run/build the app on their own PC they would need to fork it on GitHub and if they wished to add or improve anything on the app they would need to use Git Clone to work with the files on their local device.To run the code as is after forking the repository and they would need to then link their GitHub and render accounts andbuild the website for themselves by first selecting the option for creating a web service, then linking the GitHub repository, they would need to enter the build command 'pip install streamlit & pip install -r requirements.txt' and then entering the strat command 'streamlit run app.py' and simply deploying to render.
